# ROS_turtlebot2
This is a recording about Yu Zhenning's PHD Experiment on ROS based Turtlebot2 control system.
The robot Hardware includes : 

1.a Kobuki mobile robot

2.a Jetson TX1(BNUZ) TX1(UM)

3.a Kinect V1(BNUZ) V2(UM)

4.a RPlidar A1(BNUZ) A2(BNUZ,UM)

Algorithm Routine:
Based on ROS, Simulink reading Turtlebot2 \odom, \scan, \rplidar, \camera signal.
